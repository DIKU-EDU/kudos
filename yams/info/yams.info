1 Overview
**********

This manual documents `YAMS' version 1.4.1.

   `YAMS' is a machine simulator. It contains simulated CPUs, memory
and IO-mapped simulated hardware devices such as disks and consoles.

   The intended use of `YAMS' is to provide a platform for operating
system implementation courses. `YAMS' is very much like a real machine,
but it can be used as a normal UNIX process. `YAMS' has also very
simple, but still realistic hardware interface. These features make it
an easy platform for OS development.

File: yams.info,  Node: Configuration Overview,  Next: Configuring the Simulator,  Up: Configuration

3.1 Configuration Overview
==========================

The configuration files are looked (in this order):
  1. in the current directory file `./yams.conf'

  2. in the home directory file `$HOME/.yams.conf'

  3. in `/etc/yams.conf'

   Configuration file consists of four kinds of sections.  Sections are
separated by the following syntax

     Section "section-name"
        var val
        ...
     EndSection

   Each `var' is an identifier, consisting of letters. Values `val' are
either strings (inside quotation marks) or integer values. Integers can
be in decimal notation (the default), or in hexadecimal when they are
preceded with "0x". E.g., 1234 is in decimal and 0xFFFF is in
hexadecimal notation.

   Comments begin with the hash mark '#'. Everything up to the trailing
newline will be ignored.

   The valid section names are:
   * "simulator" (*note Configuring the Simulator::.)

   * "disk" (*note Configuring the Disk::.)

   * "tty" (*note Configuring the Terminal::.)

   * "nic" (*note Configuring the Network::.)

   * "plugin" (*note Configuring I/O plugins::.)

   The `"simulator"' section is mandatory. Other sections are optional
and should be specified only if the corresponding devices are to be
included into the simulated machine.


File: yams.info,  Node: Configuring the Simulator,  Next: Configuring the Disk,  Prev: Configuration Overview,  Up: Configuration

3.2 Configuring the Simulator
=============================

   * `cpus INTEGER'

     This option specifies the number of CPUs in the simulated machine.
     This can be an integer from 1 to 64. That, is `YAMS' can support
     up to 64 different CPUs. This option is mandatory.

   * `memory INTEGER'

     This option specifies the amount of memory in 4 kilobytes pages.
     So, for example, if this option is set to 1024, this means that
     YAMS has totally 1024 * 4KB = 4096 KB of memory. The maximum
     amount of memory YAMS supports is 512 megabytes, which is 131072
     pages. This option is mandatory.

   * `clock-speed INTEGER'

     This option specifies the "clock rate" of YAMS simulator. This
     option is mandatory.

   * `cpu-irq INTEGER'

     This option specifies the harware interrupt line that is used for
     inter-CPU interrupts.

   * `big-endian'

     Simulate a big-endian machine. This is the default if neither
     `big-endian' or `little-endian' is present in the configuration
     file.

   * `little-endian'

     Simulate a little-endian machine. Note that this feature is not
     tested.



File: yams.info,  Node: Configuring the Disk,  Next: Configuring the Terminal,  Prev: Configuring the Simulator,  Up: Configuration

3.3 Configuring the Disk
========================

   * `filename STRING'

     This option specifies the file name of the disk image. The
     simulator reads this disk image or creates new if the file doesn't
     exist.

   * `sector-size INTEGER'

     This option specifies the sector size (in bytes) of the simulated
     disk device.

   * `sectors INTEGER'

     This option specifies the number of sectors in the simulated disk
     device.

   * `vendor STRING'

     This option specifies the vendor string of the simulated disk
     device.  The maximum length of the string is 8 characters.

   * `irq INTEGER'

     This option specifies the IRQ of the simulated device. The valid
     values are from 0 to 4.

   * `cylinders INTEGER'

     This option specifies the number of cylinders in the simulated disk
     device. Note that the number of sectors must be a multiple of the
     number of cylinders.

   * `rotation-time INTEGER'

     This option specifies the disk rotation time in simulated
     milliseconds.

   * `seek-time INTEGER'

     This option specifies the full disk seek time in simulated
     milliseconds.

   The options `irq', `filename', `sector-size' and `sectors' are
mandatory, other are optional.


File: yams.info,  Node: Configuring the Terminal,  Next: Configuring the Network,  Prev: Configuring the Disk,  Up: Configuration

3.4 Configuring the Terminal
============================

   * `unix-socket STRING'

     Specifies the UNIX domain socket file where the `YAMS' will
     connect to or listen for its simulated terminal. `YAMS' will block
     until the connection has been established.

     The recommended TTY mode is an outbound connection to a UNIX domain
     socket with `yamst' on the other end, since this way `YAMS' can be
     exited and restarted without input on the other end.

   * `tcp-host STRING'

     Specifies the remote host name (either DNS name or IP address) of
     the host where to connect the simulated terminal device. `YAMS'
     will block until the connection has been established.

     If `listen' is specified, this specifies which interfaces to
     listen at the local host. E.g. to prevent connections from other
     hosts one provides `localhost' as the host name. Setting the host
     name to the empty string `""' means that all interfaces should be
     listened.

   * `listen'

     Specifies that `YAMS' should wait for a connection on the socket
     instead of making an outbound connection.

   * `port INTEGER'

     Specifies the TCP port where to connect `YAMS' or if `listen' was
     specified where to start the listening socket.

   * `vendor STRING'

     This option specifies the vendor string of the simulated terminal
     device. The maximum length of the string is 8 characters.

   * `irq INTEGER'

     This option specifies the IRQ of the simulated device. The valid
     values are from 0 to 4.

   * `send-delay INTEGER'

     The delay in milliseconds for writes to the device to complete.
     Value can be 0 (no delay) or greater.

   The mandatory options are `irq', either `unix-socket' or `tcp-host'
and `port'.


File: yams.info,  Node: Configuring the Network,  Next: Configuring I/O plugins,  Prev: Configuring the Terminal,  Up: Configuration

3.5 Configuring the Network
===========================

   * `mtu INTEGER'

     This option specifies the MTU, maximum transfer unit of the
     simulated network interface card (NIC) device in bytes. The MTU
     must be at least 10 bytes.

   * `unix-socket STRING'

     This option specifies the file name of the unix domain socket, in
     which `YAMS' will connect its simulated NIC device.

   * `udp-host'

     Specifies the multicast address (either DNS name or IP address)
     where to send the network device packets.

   * `port'

     Specifies the udp port where the network packets will be sent.

   * `send-delay INTEGER'

     Specifies the send delay of the network interface card (NIC). This
     is in simulated milliseconds.

   * `mac INTEGER'

     This option specifies the MAC (Media Access Control) address of
     the simulated network device. The broadcast address is always
     0xFFFFFFFF.

   * `reliability INTEGER'

     This option specifies the reliability of the network device. The
     range is from 0 to 100. The value zero means no reliability
     (everything is dropped), whereas 100 means total reliability. Note
     that if the UDP socket is used, 100% reliability is not
     guaranteed, though.

   * `dma-delay INTEGER'

     This option specifies the delay of the direct memory access (DMA).
     The unit is simulated milliseconds.

   * `vendor STRING'

     This option specifies the vendor string of the simulated terminal
     device. The maximum length of the string is 8 characters.

   * `irq INTEGER'

     This option specifies the IRQ of the simulated device. The valid
     values are from 0 to 4.

   The options `mtu', `irq' and either `unix-socket' or `udp-host' and
`port' are mandatory.


File: yams.info,  Node: Configuring I/O plugins,  Next: Config Example,  Prev: Configuring the Network,  Up: Configuration

3.6 Configuring I/O plugins
===========================

*Note I/O plugins::.

   * `unix-socket STRING', `tcp-host STRING', `listen', `port INTEGER'

     These options have the same meaning as for a TTY device. *note
     Configuring the Terminal::

   * `options STRING'

     The option string sent to the plugin device(s) at initialization.
     `YAMS' does not care what this contains, interpretation is done by
     the plugin I/O device.

   * `irq INTEGER'

     Each device in a plugin connection specifies its own IRQ. However,
     this option may be used to force the devices to use the specified
     IRQ (if they use one at all).

   * `async'

     If this option is not specified, all devices within this connection
     must act synchronously, ie. only send data as a reply to a request
     from `YAMS'. If this option is specified, the devices may also
     send asynchronous data (e.g. keyboard or mouse input).


   The mandatory options are either `unix-socket' or `tcp-host' and
`port'.

4 Invoking YAMS
***************

The format for running the `YAMS' program is:

     yams OPTION ... [binary-file [OPT] ...]

   `YAMS' supports the following options:

``binary-file''
     A binary file to be loaded into the memory and booted at startup
     (for example an operating system kernel). Binary name may be
     followed by one or more options, which are passed to the binary as
     boot arguments.

     The file may be either an ELF executable or a raw binary file. See
     hardware console command 'boot' for a detailed description of the
     boot process.  *note boot::

`--help'
`-h'
     Print an informative help message describing the options and then
     exit.

`--version'
`-v'
     Print the version number of `YAMS'.  and then exit.

`--config FILE'
`-c FILE'
     Read configuration file FILE. This will override `YAMS' default
     configuration searching *note Configuration Overview::.

`--script FILE'
`-s FILE'
     Read commands from script FILE and after that drop to interactive
     prompt. This argument can be given multiple times. Up to 255
     different script files are supported. The scripts are executed in
     the order they are specified in the command line.

`--gdb PORT'
`-g PORT'
     Open a tcp socket listening in PORT for the GDB remote protocol.
     The hardware console is unaccessible while the socket is active.
     When the user ends his GDB session either the hardware console is
     restared or the simulation is continued depending on whether the
     user instructed GDB to continue the simulation or kill it.


File: yams.info,  Node: Command Console,  Next: Simulated Machine,  Prev: Invoking YAMS,  Up: Top

5 Command Console
*****************

When `YAMS' is started for interactive use, the simulation doesn't
start automatically. Instead, the system is started into hardware
command console. This console can be thought as firmware code that
exists in actual hardware.

   The main uses of the console are data loading (kernel image loading)
and simulator running state control (starting and stopping). In
addition to the basic functionality, the console offers some features
that are useful for debugging.

   When the system is in the console mode a prompt is printed for user.
The prompt looks like this:

   YAMS [0]>

   Console commands can only be entered when command prompt is shown.
The number in parenthesis tells the number of hardware clock cycles the
system has simulated so far.

   The console understands the following commands:

* Menu:

* help::        Get list of available commands.
* quit::        Exit `YAMS'.
* memwrite::    Read file into simulator's memory.
* memread::     Write (part of) simulator's memory into a file.
* start::       Start simulation.
* step::        Run simulator one or more cycles.
* break::       Set hardware breakpoint.
* unbreak::     Clear hardware breakpoint.
* regdump::     Dump CPU and co-processor registers.
* regwrite::    Set CPU or co-processor register value.
* tlbdump::     Dump TLB for CPU.
* interrupt::   Raise hardware or software interrupt request.
* dump::        Dump part of simulator's memory to screen.
* poke::        Set word in simulator's memory.
* gdb::         Start the GDB remote protocol debugging interface
* boot::        Boot kernel image.
* numbers::     Entering numbers in `YAMS'


File: yams.info,  Node: help,  Next: quit,  Up: Command Console

5.1 help
========

Help command prints a list of available commands. If a command name is
given as an argument, extended help for that command is printed instead
of the list.


File: yams.info,  Node: quit,  Next: memwrite,  Prev: help,  Up: Command Console

5.2 quit
========

Quit command exits `YAMS'. By default, `YAMS' exists with exit code 0,
but if some other code is needed (usually when running scripted tests),
exit value in range [0,255] can be given as an argument to the
quit-command.


File: yams.info,  Node: memwrite,  Next: memread,  Prev: quit,  Up: Command Console

5.3 memwrite
============

Memwrite reads a file and writes it into simulator's memory. The first
argument to memwrite command must be a valid hardware memory address
(memory address relative to 0, not a segmented address) where to load
the file. The second argument is the name of the file to read in
quotation marks.

   The following example loads file 'test-binary' into memory starting
from address 0x00030000.

     memwrite 0x00030000 "test-binary"

   Note that no byte order conversions are done when loading the data.
The binary must already be in the correct byte order (big-endian by
default).

   *Note memread::.  *Note numbers::.


File: yams.info,  Node: memread,  Next: start,  Prev: memwrite,  Up: Command Console

5.4 memread
===========

Memread reads simulator part of simulator memory and writes it in a
file. The first argument to memread command must be a valid hardware
memory address (memory address relative to 0, not a segmented address)
where to start the read from. The second argument is the number of
bytes to read. The third argument is the name of the file to be written
in quotation marks. If the file exists, it will be overwritten.

   The following example dumps 4 kilobytes (one page) of memory starting
from address 0x0003000 to file 'dump-test-file'.

     memread 0x0003000 4096 "dump-test-file"

   *Note memwrite::.  *Note numbers::.


File: yams.info,  Node: start,  Next: step,  Prev: memread,  Up: Command Console

5.5 start
=========

Start command starts the simulation loop. While running the simulation,
`YAMS' doesn't take console commands. To return to console and stop the
simulation, send interrupt signal to `YAMS' (usually by pressing
CTRL-C).

   The stopped simulation can be continued with a new start command.

   *Note step::.


File: yams.info,  Node: tlbdump,  Next: interrupt,  Prev: regwrite,  Up: Command Console

5.6 tlbdump
===========

Tlbdump command prints the contents of translation look-aside buffer
for CPU 0. If numeric argument is given to the command, it specifies
some other CPU than CPU 0 for printing. Example:

     tlbdump 1


File: yams.info,  Node: step,  Next: break,  Prev: start,  Up: Command Console

5.7 step
========

Step runs the simulator for one clock cycle and then drops back to the
console. If numeric argument is given to step command, given number of
clock cycles is simulated before dropping back to the console.

   If premature returning is needed, `YAMS' can be forced to drop back
to the console by sending interrupt signal (usually by pressing CTRL-C).

   *Note start::.  *Note numbers::.


File: yams.info,  Node: break,  Next: unbreak,  Prev: step,  Up: Command Console

5.8 break
=========

Break command set hardware breakpoint at the address given as argument
to the command. When any CPU in the system loads instruction from the
given address, `YAMS' drops to the console.

   Only one breakpoint can be active at the same time.

   *Note unbreak::.  *Note numbers::.


File: yams.info,  Node: unbreak,  Next: regdump,  Prev: break,  Up: Command Console

5.9 unbreak
===========

Unbreak command clears hardware breakpoints.

   *Note break::.


File: yams.info,  Node: regdump,  Next: regwrite,  Prev: unbreak,  Up: Command Console

5.10 regdump
============

Regdump command prints contents of CPU and CP0 registers. By default
CPU 0 and it's co-processor 0 status is printed. If some print for some
other CPU is needed, regdump takes numeric argument which specifies the
processor number. Processors are numbered starting from 0.

   *Note regwrite::.


File: yams.info,  Node: regwrite,  Next: tlbdump,  Prev: regdump,  Up: Command Console

5.11 regwrite
=============

CPU and CP0 registers can be written with regwrite command. The first
argument for the command is the name of the register (register names
can be seen with regdump command). The second argument is the new value
to store in the given register.

   By default CPU 0 registers are affected, but register name can be
prefixed by CPU number and colon to store into some other CPU.

   Some examples:

     regwrite s0 0xdeadbeef
     regwrite 1:sp 0x00030000

   *Note regdump::.


File: yams.info,  Node: interrupt,  Next: dump,  Prev: tlbdump,  Up: Command Console

5.12 interrupt
==============

Hardware and software interrupt lines can be raised with interrupt
command. The raising will be valid only for one clock cycle. After
that, CPU will automatically clear the interrupt as non-pending.

   Interrupt command takes interrupt number as first argument. The
second argument specifies the identification number of the CPU which
should get the interrupt request. By default all requests go to CPU 0.

   The interrupt number number in closed range [0,7]. The meaning of
each number is (the numbers correspond to interrupt register bit-fields
in CP0):

`0'
     Software interrupt line 0

`1'
     Software interrupt line 1

`2'
     Hardware interrupt line 0

`3'
     Hardware interrupt line 1

`4'
     Hardware interrupt line 2

`5'
     Hardware interrupt line 3

`6'
     Hardware interrupt line 4

`7'
     Hardware interrupt line 5


File: yams.info,  Node: dump,  Next: poke,  Prev: interrupt,  Up: Command Console

5.13 dump
=========

Contents of simulator memory can be seen with the dump command. By
default, the command prints 11 words surrounding CPU 0 program counter.
This is useful when stepping programs.

   Dump takes the beginning address of the dump as an optional first
argument. The second, also optional, argument is the number of words to
dump. The address argument can be substituted by CPU register name,
which may be prefixed by CPU id. Note that for segmented addresses the
TLB of CPU 0 is used for translation. For direct access, use kernel
unmapped segments as in example below.

   Examples:

     dump
     dump v0

5.14 poke
=========

One word can be written into simulator memory by poke command. Poke
takes the memory address as the first argument and value to be stored
as second argument. Only full words can be written. Note that for
mapped address segments the TLB of CPU 0 is used for translation.

5.15 gdb
========

Open a tcp socket listening in a port for the GDB remote protocol. The
hardware console is unaccessible while the socket is active. When the
user ends his GDB session either the hardware console is restared or the
simulation is continued depending on whether the user instructed GDB to
continue the simulation or kill it.

   For example, to make yams listen in tcp socket 1500:
     gdb 1500

5.16 boot
=========

Boot command can be used to boot a kernel image. Boot command takes the
name of the kernel image file in quotation marks as its first argument.
The second argument is optional quoted string of kernel arguments.

   For example, to boot Buenos kernel from "buenos.img" with arguments:

     boot "buenos.img" "startproc=shell"

   The exact boot process is:

  1. First, check whether the image file is an ELF file. This is safe,
     since the ELF magic at the beginning is not a valid MIPS32
     instruction.

  2. If the image was an ELF file, load all program segments in the file
     into memory and set the program entry point (indicated here with
     ENTRY) to the one found in the file. 

  3. If the image file was not an ELF file, the image file is loaded
     into memory at location 0x00010000 in its entirety. The first 64
     kB are left there for interrupt vectors, initial stack etc. This
     step is equivalent to command `memwrite "image" 0x00010000'. ENTRY
     is set to 0x80010000.

  4. Program counters in all CPUs are set to ENTRY. This could be done
     manually by using command `regwrite pc ENTRY' for each CPU.

  5. Kernel argument string is copied into its memory area. This can't
     be done without `boot' command.

  6. Simulation is started. This step could be done manually with
     command `start'.

5.17 Entering numbers in the hardware console
=============================================

When a number is needed as a part of hardware console command (either
number of bytes, offset or memory address), `YAMS' always accepts
number in either binary, decimal or hexadecimal form.

   Decimal numbers (base 10) can be entered the usual way ("1234").
Binary numbers must be prefixed by letter 'b' ("b1010001").
Hexadecimal numbers must be prefixed by either '#' or '0x' ("#a02be").

   All numbers must be positive integers in closed range [0, 4294967295]
(or 2^32-1). In hex, this range is [#0, #ffffffff] and in binary [b0,
b11111111111111111111111111111111].

File: yams.info,  Node: Exceptions,  Prev: TLB,  Up: CP0

6.2.1 Exceptions
----------------

When an exception occurs, the following steps are performed by the
processor. The `EPC' register and the BD field in `Cause' register are
loaded appropriately if the EXL bit in `Status' register is not set.
The CE and ExcCode fields in `Cause' register are loaded. The EXL bit
in `status' register is set and execution is started at the exception
vector. Some exceptions load additional information to CP0 registers.

   The base for the exception vector is 0x80000000 if the BEV bit in
`Status' register is zero. Otherwise the base is 0xbfc00000. Note that
this address is not usable for code in YAMS, so BEV should be set to
zero.

   The exception codes (found in field ExcCode in `Cause' register
*Note Cause::.) and vector offsets for different exceptions are as
follows:

0
0x00
     Interrupt. An interrupt has occurred. If the IV field in `Cause'
     register is zero, the vector offset is 0x180. Otherwise the vector
     offset is 0x200.

1
0x01
     TLB modification exception. Software has attempted to store to a
     mapped address but the D bit in TLB is set indicating that the
     page is not writable. When this exception occurs, `BadVAd',
     `Context' and `EntryHi' registers contain the appropriate bits of
     the faulting address. The vector offset is 0x180.

2
0x02
     TLB exception (load or instruction fetch). The desired entry either
     was not in the TLB or it was not valid. When this exception occurs,
     `BadVAd', `Context' and `EntryHi' registers contain the
     appropriate bits of the faulting address. If the entry was not in
     the TLB and the EXL bit in the `Status' register was zero, the
     vector offset is 0x000. Otherwise the vector offset is 0x180.

3
0x03
     TLB exception (store). Behaves in exactly the same way as the load
     or instruction fetch one.

4
0x04
     Address error exception (load or instruction fetch). An address
     exception occurs when memory reference was unaligned or when an
     attempt to reference kernel address space is made in user mode.
     When this exception occurs the faulting address is loaded to the
     `BadVAd' register. The vector offset is 0x180.

5
0x05
     Address error exception (store). Behaves in exactly the same way as
     the load or instruction fetch one.

6
0x06
     Bus error exception (instruction fetch). Bus error exception occurs
     when the bus request is terminated in an error. The vector offset
     is 0x180.

7
0x07
     Bus error exception (load or store). Behaves in exactly the same
     way as the instruction fetch one.

8
0x08
     Syscall exception. A syscall instruction was executed. The vector
     offset is 0x180.

9
0x09
     Breakpoint exception. A break instruction was executed. The vector
     offset is 0x180.

10
0x0a
     Reserved instruction exception. An instruction which is not defined
     was executed. The vector offset is 0x180.

11
0x0b
     Coprocessor unusable exception. Software attempted to execute a
     coprocessor instruction but the corresponding coprocessor is not
     implemented in `YAMS' or a coprocessor 0 instruction when the
     processor was running in user mode. The vector offset is 0x180.

12
0x0c
     Arithmetic overflow. Arithmetic overflow occurred when executing an
     arithmetic instruction. The vector offset is 0x180.

13
0x0d
     Trap exception. The condition of a trap instruction was true. The
     vector offset is 0x180.

6.2.2 TLB
---------

`YAMS' TLB contains 16 entries. Each entry contains an even entry and
an odd entry. For each pair of entries TLB contains the following
fields:

VPN2   19 bits    The virtual page number is actually virtual page
                 number/2. The even entry maps the page VPN2|0 and
                 the odd entry VPN2|1, where `|' denotes
                 concatenation of bits.
G      1 bit      The global bit of the entry indicates if the
                 entry is available to all processes.
ASID   8 bits     The address space id field is used to
                 distinguish between entries of different
                 processes. The ASID bit in the TLB entry and in
                 the `EntrHi' register must be the same for the
                 entry to be valid.

   Both the even and the odd entry contain the following fields:

PFN    20 bits    The physical page frame number.
C      3 bits     The cache coherence bits. Since there is no
                 cache in `YAMS', this field is not very useful
                 and will be ignored by the simulator.
D      1 bit      Dirty bit. If this bit is zero, the page is
                 write protected. If the bit is one, page can be
                 written can can thus get dirty.
V      1 bit      Valid bit. This bit tells if the mapping is
                 valid.

6.2.3 Index
-----------

   * Register number: 0

   * Selection field: 0

   The `Index' register contains the index of the TLB used by the
`TLBP', `TLBWI' and `TLBR'. There are two fields in the `Index'
register:

Field name   Bits      Description
P            31         Probe Failure. This field is written by
                       hardware during the `TLBP' instruction to
                       indicate whether the entry is found in TLB
                       (1) or not (0). This field is not writable
                       by software.
Index        3..0       The index to the TLB. Written by software
                       to give the TLB index used by `TLBW' and
                       `TLBR' instructions. Written by hardware
                       during the `TLBP' instruction if a matching
                       entry is found.  This is a read-write field.

   The value of `Random' register is used to index the TLB by the
`TLBWR' instruction. `Random' register is a read-only register. The
`YAMS' hardware updates the value of `Random' register after each
`TLBWR' instruction. The value of `Random' register varies between 15
(number of TLB entries minus one) and the lower bound set by the
`Wired' register.  *Note Wired::. At start-up and, when the `Wired'
register is written, `Random' register is initialized to its upper
bound, 15.  There is only one field in the `Random' register:

Field name   Bits      Description
Random       3...0      The random index to the TLB. This is a
                       read-only field.

either moved from TLB to these registers or vice versa. The fields of
`EntLo0' and `EntLo1' registers are the same.

Field name   Bits      Description
PFN          25...6     Page frame number. This is a read-write

C            5...3      Cache coherency bits. These are not very
                       useful in `YAMS' since there is no cache.
                       This is a read-write field. This field is
                       ignored by `YAMS'
D            2          Dirty bit. The page is writable if this
                       bit is set. Otherwise the page is not
                       writable. This is a read-write field. Note
                       that write protected pages can't get dirty.
V            1          Valid bit. Indicates whether the entry is
                       valid.This is a read-write field.
G            0          Global bit. Indicates whether this entry
                       is usable for all processes.  When writing
                       an entry to the TLB the G bit has to set
                       in both `EntLo0' and `EntLo1' registers
                       for the G bit to be set in the TLB. This
                       is a read-write field.

   * Register number: 12

   * Selection field: 0

   The `Status' register contains various fields to indicate the
current status of the processor.

Field name   Bits      Description
CU           28         Indicates whether access to the
                       co-processor 0 is enabled. This field is
                       initialized to one, indicating access to
                       co-processor 0. This bit is a read-write
                       bit.
BEV          22         Controls the locations of the exception
                       vectors. The value of this field is zero
                       when normal exception vectors are used and
                       one when bootstrap exception vectors are
                       used. This bit is a read-write bit.
IM           15...8     Interrupt mask. Controls the enabling of
                       individual interrupt lines.  This field is
                       a read-write field. If bit is set, the
                       interrupt is enabled. The first two bits
                       correspond to the two software interrupts
                       and the rest are used for the 5 possible
                       hardware interrupts.
UM           4          Indicates the base operating mode of the
                       processor. The encoding is zero for kernel
                       mode and one for user mode. This field is
                       a read-write field.
ERL          2          The error level field. The value of this
                       field is zero when `YAMS' is operating in
                       normal level and one when `YAMS' is
                       operating in error level. When this bit is
                       set the processor is running in kernel
                       mode, all interrupts are disabled and
                       `ERET' instruction will use the `ErrEPC'
                       instead of the `EPC' register for return
                       address. This field is a read-write field.
EXL          1          The exception level field. The value of
                       this field is zero when `YAMS' is running
                       in normal level and one when in exception
                       level. When the EXL bit is set, the
                       processor is running in kernel mode, all
                       interrupts are disabled, the TLB Refill
                       exceptions use the general exception
                       vector instead of the TLB Refill vector
                       and the `EPC' register and the `BD' field
                       of the `Cause' register will not be
                       updated. This field is a read-write field.
IE           0          Interrupt enable. When this bit is zero
                       all interrupts are disabled.
             18         Must be written as zero, returns zero
                       when reading.
             31..29,    Ignored when writing, returns zero when
             27...23,  reading.

BD           31         This bit is set if the last exception
                       occurred in branch delay slot.  Otherwise
                       this bit is zero. The BD field is not
                       updated if the EXL bit in `Status'
                       register is set. This field is read-only.

                       read-only.
IV           23         This field can be used to control the
                       entry vector for interrupt exceptions.
                       When this bit is set, interrupt exceptions
                       are vectored to the special interrupt
                       vector (0x200). When this bit is not set,
                       the interrupt exceptions are vectored to
                       the general exception vector (0x180).

   The read-write register `EPC' (Exception Program Counter) contains
the address at which the execution of a program will continue after an
exception is serviced. The `EPC' register contains the virtual address
of the instruction that caused the exception or, if that instruction is
in branch delay slot, the virtual address of the branch or jump
instruction preceding that instruction. When the EXL bit in `Status'
register is set, `YAMS' will not write to the `EPC' register.

6.3 Memory
==========

6.3.1 Architecture
------------------

`YAMS' provides 2^32 bytes (4 gigabytes) virtual address space.
Virtual address space is divided in five segments shown in table below.

Virtual Address Range                  Size       Description
0xE0000000 - 0xFFFFFFFF                512 MB     Kernel Mapped
0xC0000000 - 0xDFFFFFFF                512 MB     Supervisor Mapped
0xA0000000 - 0xBFFFFFFF                512 MB     Kernel Unmapped Uncached
0x80000000 - 0x9FFFFFFF                512 MB     Kernel Unmapped
0x00000000 - 0x7FFFFFFF                2 GB       User Mapped

   Addresses in mapped segments are translated through TLB. Unmapped
kernel segments generate physical addresses to lowest 512 MB of
physical memory.  Cache is not implemented so there are no differences
between the two kernel unmapped segments.

6.3.2 Kernel Unmapped Uncached Segment
--------------------------------------

Kernel unmapped segment is further divided into following memory areas:

Virtual Address Range                        Description
0xB0008000 - 0xBFFFFFFF                      Memory mapped device IO-area
0xB0001000 - 0xB0001FFF                      Kernel Boot parameters string
0xB0000000 - 0xB0000FFF                      Device descriptors
0xA0000000 - 0xAFFFFFFF                      Kernel binary and stack

6.3.3 Accessing segments
------------------------

All segments are accessible while processor is in kernel mode. In user
mode only User mapped segment is accessible. Accessing other segments
generates Address Error. Since no supervisor mode is implemented
Supervisor Mapped segment is accessible only in kernel mode.

6.3.4 Address Translation
-------------------------

Unmapped Segments

   Kernel Unmapped segments generate physical addresses in the
following way:

Segment                        Virtual Address                    Physical Address
Kernel Unmapped Uncached       0xA0000000 - 0xAFFFFFFF            0x00000000 - 0x0FFFFFFF
Kernel Unmapped                0x80000000 - 0x9FFFFFFF            0x00000000 - 0x1FFFFFFF

   Addresses 0xB0000000-0xBFFFFFFF are used in memory mapped io-devices
and are not threated as normal physical memory.

   TLB-address translation

   *Note EntrHi::.

   *Note EntLo0 and EntLo1::.

   *Note TLB::.

   *Note Exceptions::.

   Memory is mapped in 4096-byte pages in `YAMS'. Bits 31-12 of the
virtual address refer to the page. Bits 11-0 are used indexing inside
the page. Address translation is performed in the following way:

1
     Find TLB-entry, whose VPN2 field matches to the bits 31-13 of the
     virtual address and G bit is set or ASID field matches the current
     process ASID (obtainde from EntryHi register). If TLB-entry is not
     found and reference type is load raise TLB exception 0x02.
     Otherwise, if TLB-entry is not found, raise TLB exception 0x03.

2
     Check bit 12 (EvenOddBit) in virtual address. If zero use mapping
     for even page (TLB-entry fields PFN0, C0, D0, V0), otherwise use
     mapping for odd page (TLB-entry fields PFN1, C1, D1, V1).

3
     Check validity bit of page (V-field of even/odd page mapping in
     TLB-entry). If one page is valid and access to the page is
     permitted. Otherwise raise TLB exception 0x02 (load) or 0x03
     (store).

4
     Check dirty bit of page (D-field of even/odd page mapping in
     TLB-entry). If zero and reference type is store, raise TLB
     modification exception 0x01. Note that dirty bit is also write
     protection bit.

5
     Generate physical address by concatenating bits 19-0 of PFN-field
     and bits 11-0 of virtual address.

6.4 Memory mapped I/O devices
=============================

All I/O operations in `YAMS' are memory-mapped. The I/O address space
is the upper half of the kernel unmapped uncached segment, ie. the
first byte is at the address 0xb0000000 and the last byte at
0xbfffffff. Reads or writes to this area will not cause an exception
provided that the CPU is in kernel mode and the read/write is naturally
aligned.

   Reads from unused portions of the I/O area return 0. However, the
operating system should not rely this to be so and instead consider the
result undefined. Writes to unused portions have no effect.

   Reads from the I/O area function just as normal memory reads.
However, writing anything other than a word (e.g. a byte or a half
word) to an I/O 'port' of a device will give unpredicted results. So
writing to I/O ports should be restricted to whole words. Some devices
may have an additional memory mapped I/O area, where the result of
writing bytes or half-words depends on the device.

   The I/O address space is partitioned as follows:

0xb0000000 - 0xb0000fff
     This area holds the 128 device descriptors which describe the
     hardware devices that are available in the system. For details:
     *Note Device descriptors::. This area is read-only, meaning that
     writes have no effect.

0xb0001000 - 0xb0001fff
     This area holds the kernel boot parameters as a 0-terminated
     (C-style) string. This area is read-only, meaning that writes have
     no effect.

0xb0002000 - 0xb0007fff
     This area is reserved for future use. This area is read-only,
     meaning that writes have no effect.

0xb0008000 - 0xbfffffff
     This area holds the actual I/O ports and any additional memory
     areas for the devices. Whether writing to a certain address has
     any effect depends on the device and port/area in question.

6.4.1 Device descriptors
------------------------

In the memory range from 0xb0000000 to 0xb0000fff are located 128
device descriptors that describe the hardware devices. Each of the
descriptors is 32 bytes long and has the following structure:

OFFSET       SIZE       DESCRIPTION
0x00         1 word      Device type code. Type code 0 is not used by
                        any devices, and it means that this descriptor
                        is unused and should be ignored. *Note Device
                        type codes::.
0x04         1 word      Device I/O address base. All I/O port offsets
                        of a device are relative to this address.
0x08         1 word      The length of the device's I/O address area
                        in bytes. This will always be a multiple of 4,
                        since all ports are 32 bits wide.
0x0C         1 word      The number of the IRQ that the device
                        generates. Possible values are from 0 to 5. A
                        value of -1 (0xffffffff) means the device will
                        not generate any IRQs.
0x10         8 bytes     Vendor string. These bytes are used to
                        describe the model of the device or some other
                        information intended to be read by humans. The
                        operating system may safely ignore the
                        contents of these bytes.  These bytes may
                        contain any values and need not be
                        0-terminated.
0x18         2 words     Reserved. The contents of these word should
                        be considered undefined.

   When starting, the operating system should read through _all_ device
descriptors, ignoring those with device type code of 0. In practise
there will be no more devices after the first descriptor with type code
0, but the OS must not rely on this as it may very well change in the
future.

6.4.2 Device type codes
-----------------------

A device is identified by its type code. The type codes have the
following meaning and grouping:

0x100
     The 0x100 series is for so-called meta-devices, such as those that
     are integrated into the motherboard chipset.

0x101
     System memory information. *Note Meminfo::.

0x102
     System real-time clock device (RTC). *Note RTC::.

0x103
     System software shutdown device. *Note Shutdown::.

0x200
     The 0x200 series is for TTYs and other character-buffered devices.

0x201
     The basic TTY as described in this document. *Note Terminals::.

0x300
     The 0x300 series is for disks and other block-buffered devices.

0x301
     Hard disk as described in this document. *Note Disks::.

0x400
     The 0x400 series is for network devices.

0x401
     NIC as described in this document. *Note NIC::.

0x500
     The 0x500 series is for devices that have both character- and
     block-buffered characteristics.

0xC00
     CPU status "devices". The last two hexadecimal digits indicate the
     number of the CPU, from 0 to 255. *Note CPU status::.

6.4.3 Hardware interrupts
-------------------------

Interrupts (IRQs) caused by hardware devices are distributed evenly to
all CPUs since they are not CPU specific (unlike other exceptions).

   If `YAMS' is configured with more than one CPU, the operating system
_must_ support all processors and initialize them symmetrically or some
device IRQs may be lost (more correctly never noticed or handled rather
than lost).

   *Note Configuring the Simulator::.


File: yams.info,  Node: I/O plugins,  Next: Meminfo,  Prev: Hardware interrupts,  Up: Memory Mapped Devices

6.4.4 I/O plugins
-----------------

`YAMS' supports user-supplied I/O devices in the form of pluggable I/O
devices, or I/O plugins. An I/O plugin is a separate program which
communicates with `YAMS' over a stream (unix or TCP) socket, responding
to writes to and reads from the I/O area(s) of the device.

   The documentation of the I/O ports and possible memory mapped I/O
area should be provided with the plugin device.

   If you want to implement your own I/O plugin, the protocol is
specified in the file 'README.PLUGIO'.

   *Note Configuring I/O plugins::.

6.4.5 System memory information device
--------------------------------------

The system memory information device has device type code 0x101 and it
has the following port:

OFFSET   NAME       R/W   DESCRIPTION
0x00     PAGES      R      This port contains the number of
                          physical memory pages in the
                          system. Each page is 4096 bytes
                          (4kB) in size.

6.4.6 System real-time clock device
-----------------------------------

The RTC device (device type code 0x102) contains information about the
speed and uptime of the system. It has the following ports:

OFFSET   NAME       R/W   DESCRIPTION
0x00     MSEC       R      Milliseconds elapsed since the
                          machine started.
0x04     CLKSPD     R      Machine clock speed in Hz.

   The milliseconds are calculated from elapsed clock cycles and the
simulator's virtual clock speed, and have no relatioin whatsoever with
real word time.

   *Note Configuring the Simulator::.


File: yams.info,  Node: Shutdown,  Next: CPU status,  Prev: RTC,  Up: Memory Mapped Devices

6.4.7 Software shutdown device
------------------------------

The software shutdown device (device type code 0x103) is used to exit
from `YAMS' from within the running program (OS). It has the following
port:

OFFSET   NAME       R/W   DESCRIPTION
0x00     SHUTDN     W      Writing the magic word to this
                          port will shut down the machine.

   The magic word is 0x0badf00d. Writing the magic word to the port will
immediately (after the clock cycle is finished) cause the simulator to
exit.

   If magic word 0xdeadc0de is written to the same port, YAMS will not
exit, but will drop to command console. This feature is usefull for
kernel panic routies, because after error condition, the state of the
system can be inspected.


File: yams.info,  Node: CPU status,  Next: Terminals,  Prev: Shutdown,  Up: Memory Mapped Devices

6.4.8 CPU status devices
------------------------

Each CPU in the system has a status metadevice associated with it. The
device type codes for CPU status devices range from 0xC00 to 0xC3F, the
last two hexadecimal digits indicating the number of the CPU. The
device has the following two ports:

OFFSET   NAME       R/W   DESCRIPTION
0x00     STATUS     R      CPU status word.
0x04     COMMAND    W      CPU command port for inter-CPU
                          interrupts.

   The STATUS word contains the following information:

BIT   NAME     DESCRIPTION
0     RUNNING   If the CPU is running this bit has the value 1.
               Since all CPUs are always running in `YAMS' this
               bit always has the value 1.
1     IRQ       This bit indicates whether this CPU status device
               has a pending interrupt request.
31    ICOMM     The last command issued to this device was
               incorrect.

   The command port is used to generate and clear inter-CPU interrupts
on the CPU of the CPU status device. The command port accepts the
following commands:

COMMAND        DESCRIPTION
0x00           Generate interrupt
0x01           Clear the interrupt

   *Caution:* Since the maximum number of device descriptors is 128,
configuring `YAMS' with too many processors will cause undesirable
effects.

   *Note Configuring the Simulator::.

6.4.9 Terminal devices
----------------------

Only terminals with device type code 0x201 are covered in this section.

   A terminal (TTY) is a character buffered I/O device from which data
can be read when it is available and to which data can be written in
certain speed. Reads and writes are done one byte (character) at a time
(use the lowest 8 bits of a word). A terminal device has the following
ports:

OFFSET   NAME       R/W   DESCRIPTION
0x00     STATUS     R      Status bits for the TTY device.
0x04     COMMAND    W      Port for giving commands to the
                          TTY device.
0x08     DATA       RW     Data port for reading from and
                          writing to the TTY. Only the 8
                          lowest bits are used.

   Operating the TTY is based mostly on interpreting the status bits,
which are described in the following table. Reading from or writing to
DATA will update the status bits before the next clock cycle.

BIT   NAME     DESCRIPTION
0     RAVAIL    There is meaningful (read: real) data available in
               DATA. If this bit is not set, reads from DATA will
               return 0.
1     WBUSY     The TTY is writing out its internal buffer. When
               this bit is set, all writes to DATA will be ignored.
2     RIRQ      The TTY has pending IRQ because new data became
               available.
3     WIRQ      The TTY has pending IRQ because WBUSY has been
               cleared.
4     WIRQE     Write interrupt generation is enabled if this is
               1, disabled if 0.
29    ICOMM     The last command issued to the COMMAND port was
               unrecognized.
30    EBUSY     The last command issued to the COMMAND port could
               not be handled because the TTY was busy.
31    ERROR     Undefined error in the device. The TTY is to be
               considered unusable if this bit is set.

   The following commands are available to control a TTY device:

0x01
     Reset RIRQ. Will zero the RIRQ bit, indicating that the IRQ
     generated has been handled.

0x02
     Reset WIRQ. Acts similarly to the RIRQ resetting.

0x03
     Enables Write IRQs.

0x04
     Disables Write IRQs.


   Reading from a TTY device by the operating system would typically be
done as follows.

   When there is input data available, the TTY will raise an IRQ. The
handler should check just in case that RAVAIL is really set (should
always be if RIRQ is set) before reading. It will then read one byte
from DATA into its own buffer. After reading the byte, it should check
if more data is available by checking the RAVAIL bit. Data can be read
as long as RAVAIL is set, and all of it should be read too or the IRQ
will be raised again after exiting the handler. When all available data
is read, the handler should reset the RIRQ bit (command 0x01) and check
once more that no data arrived before RIRQ reset. Every incoming byte
raises RIRQ only once.

   Writing to a TTY device would typically be implemented by the OS as
follows.

   First check WBUSY. If WBUSY is set, the thread should go to sleep.
When WBUSY is cleared an interrupt is raised. The handler should wake
up the writing thread and reset WIRQ (command 0x02). The writing thread
should write the output one byte at a time as long as WBUSY is not set.
When WBUSY becomes set, the thread should go to sleep again.  This
cycle is repeated until all output is written. If multiple bytes is
written in interrupt hanlder, write IRQs must be disabled while writing
so that other CPUs won't end up in the interrupt handler when clearly
not needing to do so.

   *Note Configuring the Terminal::.

6.4.10 Hard disk devices
------------------------

Only disks with device type code 0x301 are covered in this section.

   A disk device transfers data between disk and memory using DMA.  It
generates interrupts when it has completed a DMA transfer. The data is
stored on an image file in the directory from where `YAMS' is run.

   A disk device has the following I/O ports:

OFFSET   NAME       R/W   DESCRIPTION
0x00     STATUS     R      Status bits for the disk device.
0x04     COMMAND    W      Port for issuing commands to the
                          disk.
0x08     DATA       R      Return value port for query
                          commands. The data will be
                          available before the next clock
                          cycle after the query command is
                          written to the COMMAND port.
0x0C     TSECTOR    RW     Number of the disk sector which
                          should be read/written.
0x10     DMAADDR    RW     Start address of the memory
                          buffer which will be used for
                          sector reads and writes.  The size
                          of the buffer is the same as the
                          size of the disk sector and
                          addressing is 0x00000000-based
                          unmapped.

   The following table describes the status bits of a disk device:

BIT   NAME     DESCRIPTION
0     RBUSY     The disk is busy reading from disk to memory.
1     WBUSY     The disk is busy writing from memory to disk.
2     RIRQ      The disk has finished a read operation and
               generated an IRQ. The IRQ line is held raised by
               the disk while this bit is set.
3     WIRQ      The disk has finished a write operation and
               generated an IRQ. The IRQ line is held raised by
               the disk while this bit is set.

27    ISECT     The sector number given to a read/write request is
               invalid.
28    IADDR     The address given to a read/write request did not
               reside entirely in physical memory.
29    ICOMM     The last command issued to the COMMAND port was
               unrecognized.
30    EBUSY     The last command issued to the COMMAND port could
               not be handled because the disk was busy.
31    ERROR     Undefined error in the device. The disk is to be
               considered unusable if this bit is set.

   The commands that can be issued to a disk device through the COMMAND
port are listed in the following table. Status changes caused by the
command will be visible in the status register before the next clock
cycle (like in normal memory writes on MIPS32 architecture).

0x01
     Begin read operation. Will begin a transfer from the sector
     TSECTOR to the buffer addresses by DMAADDR. An IRQ is generated on
     completion.

0x02
     Begin write operation. Will begin a transfer from the buffer
     addressed by DMAADDR to the sector TSECTOR. An IRQ is generated on
     completion.

0x03
     Reset RIRQ. Will clear the RIRQ bit, indicating that the IRQ
     generated has been handled. This will cause the disk to not raise
     the IRQ line any further unless there is another IRQ pending
     (should never happen).

0x04
     Reset WIRQ. Acts similarly to the RIRQ resetting.

0x05
     Get number of sectors in the disk, returned in DATA.

0x06
     Get sector size in bytes, returned in DATA.

0x07
     Get sectors per cylinder, returned in DATA.

0x08
     Get disk rotation period in simulated milliseconds, returned in
     DATA.

0x09
     Get disk full seek time in simulated milliseconds, returned in
     DATA.


   Using a disk in the OS is very simple. A thread wanting to write to a
disk will first reserve the disk for itself. Then it will write the
disk sector and the DMA transfer buffer address to TSECTOR and DMAADDR
and issue a request for write operation to COMMAND. It should then
check if there were any errors. If no errors occured, the thread will
go to sleep.

   When the operation is finished, the disk will raise an interrupt. The
interrupt handler should then wake up the thread that has reserved the
disk and reset the WIRQ bit. The thread will then release the disk
reservation and go about its business.

   Reading from the disk is done similarly.

6.4.11 Network interface cards
------------------------------

Only network cards with device type code 0x401 are covered in this
section.

   A network interface card functions very much like the disk, except
of course it will make IRQs on its own when packets arrive.

   A NIC is "fully full duplex", meaning it has both a receive and a
send buffer which can be used simultaneously ie. a frame can be
received while sending is in progress. When a frame is received in the
receive buffer it must be then DMA transferred to main memory before
the next frame can be received.

   A network interface card has the following I/O ports:

OFFSET   NAME       R/W   DESCRIPTION
0x00     STATUS     R      Status bits for the network
                          device.
0x04     COMMAND    W      Port for issuing commands to the
                          NIC.
0x08     HWADDR     R      Link level address of the NIC.
0x0C     MTU        R      Maximum transfer unit of the NIC
                          in bytes.
0x10     DMAADDR    RW     Start address of the memory
                          buffer which will be used for
                          frame sends and receives. The size
                          of the buffer is the size of the
                          MTU and addressing is
                          0x00000000-based unmapped.

   The frames (or packets, since there is no trailer, but the term frame
is used in this document) send to the network have the structure
defined in the following table. Note that the addresses are in network
byte order, which is big-endian (since `YAMS' is also big-endian by
default, this is no problem).

OFFSET   SIZE        NAME      DESCRIPTION
0x00     1 word      DSTADDR    Link level address of the
                               destination in network byte order.
0x04     1 word      SRCADDR    Link level address of the sender
                               in network byte order.
0x08     MTU-8       PAYLOAD    Link level payload, can be up to
                               MTU - 8 bytes. The payload length
                               is not defined here, it can be
                               defined in the headers of the
                               higher level protocol. The full
                               MTU is always transfered by the
                               hardware.

   Network device status bits are described in the following table

BIT   NAME        DESCRIPTION
0     RXBUSY       The receive buffer is either receiving a
                  frame or one has been received but not yet
                  transferred to memory. If this bit is set new
                  frames cannot be received. This bit must be
                  cleared manually with the ready to receive
                  command.
1     RBUSY        The NIC is transferring a frame from the
                  receive buffer to memory.
2     SBUSY        The NIC is transferring a frame from memory
                  to the send buffer.
3     RXIRQ        The NIC has received a frame and generated
                  an IRQ. The frame is ready to be transferred
                  from the receive buffer.
4     RIRQ         A DMA transfer from the receive buffer to
                  memory has completed and an IRQ was generated.
5     SIRQ         A DMA transfer from memory to the send
                  buffer was completed and an IRQ was generated.
6     PROMISC      The NIC is in promiscuous mode, receiving
                  all frames instead of just those addressed to
                  it.

27    NOFRAME      There is no frame available in the receive
                  buffer but a read transfer was requested.
28    IADDR        The DMA address given did not reside
                  entirely in physical memory.
29    ICOMM        The last command issued to the COMMAND port
                  was unrecognized.
30    EBUSY        The last command issued to the COMMAND port
                  could not be handled because the NIC was busy.
31    ERROR        Undefined error in the device. The NIC is to
                  be considered unusable if this bit is set.

   When a DMA transfer from memory to the send buffer is requested, the
NIC will wait for the send buffer to be available (the previous
transmit completed) before doing the actual transfer and then begin
transmitting the transferred frame. That is why there is no IRQ after
the frame has actually been transmitted into the network.

   Available commands for a NIC are listed in the following table

0x01
     Start a DMA transfer from the receive buffer to the memory buffer
     addressed by DMAADDR.

0x02
     Start a DMA transfer from the memory buffer addressed by DMAADDR
     into the send buffer.

0x03
     Clear the RXIRQ bit, indicating that the interrupt has been handled
     and the NIC need not generate it any more for this frame.

0x04
     Clear the RIRQ bit.

0x05
     Clear the SIRQ bit.

0x06
     Clear the RXBUSY bit. This tells the NIC that it can now receive a
     new frame into the receive buffer.

0x07
     Enter promiscuous mode.

0x08
     Exit promiscuous mode.


   A typical interrupt handler for a NIC works as follows. When a frame
is received (RXIRQ) the handler will request a DMA transfer from the
NIC into the memory buffer allocated for incoming frames. It will then
clear the RXIRQ bit. When the DMA transfer is completed and the NIC
generates an IRQ (RIRQ), the handler will do with the received frame
whatever it needs to and then clear both RXBUSY and RIRQ bits.

   When a frame needs to be sent, the sending thread will reserve the
NIC and check if SBUSY bit is set. If set, the thread will go to sleep.
When SBUSY is cleared (frame send complete), the interrupt handler will
wake up the waiting thread. The thread will then request a send
operation and check for errors. It can then exit, there is no need for
the sending thread to wait for anything after this.

7 How to build cross-compiling GCC
**********************************

Building a cross compiler has really nothing to do with `YAMS'.  Since
one is needed to generate code for `YAMS' unless a native MIPS32
compiler is used, here are short instructions for building GCC 4.0.2 as
a cross-compiler for MIPS32 (actually MIPS ISA 2).

7.1 How to build a GCC cross-compiler and binutils
==================================================

To build binaries for the `YAMS' simulator, a C compiler and assembler
is needed. These are provided by the GNU binutils
(`http://sources.redhat.com/binutils/')and GCC (`http://gcc.gnu.org/')
packages. Binutils is needed mainly for the GNU assembler and linker,
but the others can be quite useful too.

   You do not necessarily need a cross compiler to create code for YAMS,
any native compiler generating 32-bit big-endian MIPS code should do
the job.

   These instructions are tested on binutils 2.16 and 2.16.1, gcc 3.4.3
and 4.0.2; they should work for newer versions also. The use of GNU
make (gmake) is recommended, the build may fail if using other make.
Since we only need a C compiler for Buenos, the gcc-core package is
used here. The full package can also be used with these instructions,
but enabling other languages may or may not work.

   Download the tarballs to a suitable empty directory and do the
following:

     #!/bin/sh

     # Extract the packages
     gunzip -c binutils-2.16.1.tar.gz | tar xf -
     gunzip -c gcc-core-4.0.2.tar.gz | tar xf -


     TARGET=mips-elf
     PREFIX=/u/projects/buenos/util/sparc


     # Build in a separate directory
     mkdir build-binutils
     cd build-binutils
     ../binutils-2.16.1/configure --target=$TARGET --prefix=$PREFIX -v
     gmake all

     gmake install

     PATH=$PREFIX/bin:$PATH
     export PATH

     cd ..
     mkdir build-gcc
     cd build-gcc
     ../gcc-4.0.2/configure --with-gnu-ld --with-gnu-as --without-nls
       --enable-languages=c --disable-multilib --target=$TARGET --prefix=$PREFIX -v
     gmake all

     gmake install

   As can be seen, the format chosen for the object files is ELF, since
it is about the only one supported by gcc on MIPS target. You may of
course choose any format you like. However, `YAMS' only supports
loading ELF executables or raw binary files, and ELF is the format used
by Buenos userland programs.

   PREFIX is naturally the directory under which the software should be
installed. When installed, the cross-compiler binaries are found as
"$PREFIX/$TARGET/bin/*" and "$PREFIX/bin/$TARGET-*". TARGET is the
architecture/platform to cross-compile to. Specifying mips-elf will
produce MIPS big-endian code in ELF format, mipsel-elf would produce
MIPS little-endian code in ELF.

   PREFIX should be same for both binutils and GCC. If you want to use
different prefixes you must also give `configure' the option
`--with-as=$BINUTILPREFIX/bin/mips-elf-as' when building GCC.

8 GDB remote debugging interface
********************************

`GDB' remote debugging interface allows you to use `GDB' debugging
facilities with a process (e.g., `buenos') run inside `YAMS' simulator.
The `GDB' interface is partly an alternative to the `YAMS' command
console. *Note Command Console::.

* Menu:

* Setup::         Setting up the cross-platform GDB
* Starting::      Starting the remote debugging in `YAMS'
* Using::         Using the debugger
* Shortcomings::  What can be done and what cannot be done?


File: yams.info,  Node: Setup,  Next: Starting,  Up: GDB remote debugging

8.1 Setup
=========

First, obtain the `GDB' source code. The official home page is
`http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/'. We have tested `GDB' version 7.2.
After fetching the source code and unpacking you have to compile `GDB'
with the target `mips-elf':

     $ tar zxvf gdb-7.2.tar.gz
     $ cd gdb-7.2
     $ ./configure --target=mips-elf --prefix=/path/to/your/target/dir
     $ make
     $ make install

   If the compilation and installation was successful, there should be a
`mips-elf-gdb' binary in your prefix/bin directory.


File: yams.info,  Node: Starting,  Next: Using,  Prev: Setup,  Up: GDB remote debugging

8.2 Starting
============

The GDB remote debugging interface is executed by giving a command line
switch to yams once the binary is started. The remote debugging is
enabled by starting `yams' binary with the switch -gdb PORT, where PORT
is the tcp port where yams listens to tcp connections from `GDB'. After
this you have to start the `mips-elf-gdb' and setup the connection. For
example, here is how you would start the debugging session with
`buenos' and `yams' listening in tcp port 1500 for remote `GDB'
connections.

     $ cd buenos
     $ yams --gdb 1500 buenos testconsole

     TTY connection established
     gdb interface listening on port 1500

   The last line from `YAMS' indicates that the simulation is stopped
and the gdb interface is listening on tcp port 1500. Now we can start
the gdb with buenos binary as its argument. We have to give gdb the
command `target remote:port' so that the gdb can contact `yams'.

     $ cd buenos
     $ mips-elf-gdb buenos

   From the last line you can see that the `YAMS' simulator has been
interrupted when the kernel was in the `_start'.  See the next section
for more examples on how to use the gdb interface.  *Note Using::.

8.3 Using
=========

Refer to the GDB manual for details on using the debugger. Here we give
brief overview of few of the features available.

   Yams supports number of concurrent CPUS that are mapped to threads
in GDB, you can acess them with `info threads' command, the active
thread is marked with '*':
     (gdb) info threads
       4 Thread 4  0x80010004 in _start () at init/_boot.S:47
       3 Thread 3  0x80010004 in _start () at init/_boot.S:47
       2 Thread 2  0x80010004 in _start () at init/_boot.S:47
     * 1 Thread 1  0x80010004 in _start () at init/_boot.S:47

   You can switch active CPU with `thread' command and show the
contents of the registers with `info' command:
     (gdb) thread 2
     [...]
     (gdb) info registers
               zero       at       v0       v1       a0       a1       a2       a3
      R0   00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
     [...]

   To show the source code, use the `list' command:
     (gdb) l
     2              .ent    _start
     43
     44      _start:
     45              # If we are running on another CPU than 0, wait until CPU 0
     46              # has initialized the system
     47              _FETCH_CPU_NUM(t0)
     48              bnez    t0, init_wait_loop
     49
     50              # Only CPU 0 runs these
     51              li      sp, 0x8000fffc    # Initialize SP

   To set a hardware breakpoint and continue execution until the
breakpoint is hit use `hbreak' and `continue' commands (Note that only a
single HW breakpoint are currently supported):
     (gdb) hbreak scheduler_schedule
     Hardware assisted breakpoint 1 at 0x80012400: file kernel/scheduler.c, line 192.
     (gdb) cont
     Continuing.
     Can't send signals to this remote system.  SIGHUP not sent.

     Program received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap.
     0x80011624 in interrupt_handle (cause=16384) at kernel/interrupt.c:171
     171             if (interrupt_handlers[i].device == NULL)
   The GDB reports only the active CPU's position when the breakpoint is
hit, use `info threads' to verify that they are actually in
`scheduler_schedule'.

   To examine a variables value, use the `print' command:
     (gdb) p  thread_table
     $1 = {{context = 0x0, user_context = 0x0, state = THREAD_FREE, sleeps_on = 0,
         pagetable = 0x0, process_id = 0, next = 0, dummy_alignment_fill = {0, 0,
           0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}} <repeats 32 times>}

   To kill the simulation:
     (gdb) kill
     Kill the program being debugged? (y or n) y
   This will also exit `yams' simulation.

8.4 Shortcomings
================

   * Signals and exceptions (e.g. division by zero exception)  are not
     caught or reported to the gdb interface

   * Only single hardware breakpoint is supported due to the
     limitations of yams
        * since signals cannot be reported to the GDB there is no way to
          support software breakpoits or data watch points

   * There is no access for the MIPS CP0, use `yams' hardware console
     for that

   * CTRL-C does not work in YAMS console if GDB interface is run but
     you can use CTRL-C or break signal in GDB to stop the simulation
     and trap the control to the GDB

   * Buenos should be compiled with -O0 flag or the optimizations will
     clobber GDB's source display

   * Single-stepping via `step' or `next' commands are not working

   * GDB `detach' is not supported

                         Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program,"
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification.")  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you."

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version," you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY
 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND AN IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) 19YY  NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
     as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
     of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
     with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 20YY NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
     type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
     to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
     for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
     interest in the program `Gnomovision'
     (which makes passes at compilers) written
     by James Hacker.

     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.
